0x05. Python - Exceptions

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
What are exceptions and how to use them
When do we need to use exceptions
How to correctly handle an exception
What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
How to raise a builtin exception
When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
